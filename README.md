I'm Student Developer 5tarlight! <br />
(currently using name 'YEAHx4') <br />
though I'm not professional, I just like this. <br /> <br />
I started coding in 2015(I was 4th grade in Elementary School) with C. <br />
Under is my life of coding. <br />
C -> Java -> Javascript -> Typescript -> Javascript(React) -> C++ -> C# -> Now <br /> <br />
I believe that I can be professional someday. <br />
**_TO INFINITE AND BEYOND_**
