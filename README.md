I'm Student Developer 5tarlight!


(currently using name 'YEAHx4')


though I'm not professional, I just like this.




I started coding in 2015(I was 4th grade in Elementary School) with C.


Under is my life of coding.


C -> Java -> Javascript -> Typescript -> Javascript(React) -> C++ -> C# -> Now




I believe that I can be professional someday.


**_TO INFINITE AND BEYOND_**
